If you have sqlite3, requests, and secrets installed, and setup then the project works perfectly fine, along with python 3.9 which is what I used for this assignment.
I got all of the parts of the assignment done pulling the top 250 tv shows to a file the formatting them slightly. Along with setting up github actions and other required items.

Sprint 2: 
Please have sqlite3 installed on your machine for proper usage, my project builds an incorrect data base, I really struggled to format and fit data along with writting the automated tests.
